"""The organ contract and the selftest harness.

An organ is a perception source: given a subject, it emits witnessed
Observations.  It is INERT — it reads and reports; it never mutates the world
and never grants authority.

The selftest is not optional.  The membrane doctrine's hardest-won rule is that
*an unverified membrane is net-negative* — it launders falsehood with
ground-truth authority.  So every organ must ship a `selftest()` that re-derives
its own claims from raw input and can fail.  An organ that has not passed its
selftest must not be trusted as an oracle.
