"""Formal verification of the verdict lattices — proofs, not assertions.

Every adjudication in the membrane returns a value from a small CLOSED set:
drift is MATCH / DRIFT / UNVERIFIABLE, a receipt is VALID / DRIFT / UNVERIFIABLE,
a provenance graph is VALID / BROKEN / UNVERIFIABLE. The membrane's safety rests
on three claims about those sets, claims the rest of the code merely *asserts* in
docstrings ("fail-closed", "never a silent MATCH", "composition never amplifies
trust"). This module turns the claims into machine-checked proofs.

The carriers are finite (three elements each), so exhaustive enumeration is a
COMPLETE decision procedure — every law is checked over every tuple, not sampled.
For these finite, non-temporal laws that is exactly what an explicit-state model
checker (TLA+/TLC) would do — enumerate the whole state space — so the enumeration
here IS that check, executed directly on every `pytest`, with no separate spec or
toolchain to rot. (Liveness/temporal checking would add nothing: the laws are
algebraic, not temporal.)

Two kinds of guarantee live here; the THIRD (binding the algebra to the real
adjudicators — compare_drift, compare_composite, verify_receipt, verify(),
baseline.check, _assess, trace_events) lives in tests/test_lattice*.py, which
prove the implementations equal / refine these structures.

  1. Lattice well-formedness — each verdict set, under its affirmation order
     (most-affirmative at top), is a genuine bounded lattice: the order is a
     partial order, every pair has a unique meet and join, and there is a top and
     a bottom. Proved by enumeration; for a chain this is easy, which is the
     point — the order is made explicit and checkable, not assumed.
  2. Meet = fail-closed combination — the meet (greatest lower bound) is the
     attenuation operator: combining verdicts can only move DOWN the order. It is
     commutative, associative, idempotent; the affirmative top is its identity
     (it composes away) and the bottom is absorbing (a positive detection
     dominates); and it is MONOTONE — degrading any input never improves the
     result. So composition cannot launder a worse observation set into a better
     verdict — a theorem, not a comment.

Inert and advisory like everything else: it computes and proves; it decides
nothing and grants no authority. Stdlib only.
