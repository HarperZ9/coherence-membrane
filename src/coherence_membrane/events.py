"""Temporal perception — drift episodes over the continuity stream.

The continuity loop emits a flat sequence of per-tick verdicts (MATCH / DRIFT /
UNVERIFIABLE). That tells you what happened at each instant, not the *shape* of
change over time. EventTrace reads the stream and structures it: it finds drift
EPISODES (a change began, ran, and settled), how far each drifted (peak
distance), when each settled, and the longest DWELL (run of unchanged ticks).

So a model can ground "the canvas changed at t=3, peaked at distance 18, and
settled by t=7" rather than only "tick 5 was DRIFT". This is inert analysis over
already-witnessed verdicts — it perceives nothing new and grants no authority;
it only re-shapes the witnessed stream into episodes, fail-closed on the same
closed lattice.

Episode model (stated, not implied): an episode is a maximal run that contains at
least one DRIFT, opened by the first DRIFT and closed (SETTLED) by the next MATCH.
UNVERIFIABLE ticks inside an open episode keep it open (the state is uncertain,
not confirmed-settled); a run of only UNVERIFIABLE is NOT an episode (no confirmed
change). A dwell is a run of consecutive MATCH ticks.
