"""graph_ops — pure stdlib operations over the Graph substrate.

No third-party imports. Every op is deterministic (fixed node/edge ordering from the
Graph substrate's normalisation) and total over a well-formed Graph; none mutate
their input. These are the re-derivation kernels the Graph criteria call to build
and re-check witnesses — kept separate from the criteria so a third party can re-run
a single op against a witness in isolation: adjacency, connected components, BFS
shortest-path/reachability, de Bruijn construction, and serial transitive closure.
The search + connectivity kernels (the cycle finder, tree jump-edges, and the
spanning/cut bottleneck kernels) live in graph_search, which builds on these.
