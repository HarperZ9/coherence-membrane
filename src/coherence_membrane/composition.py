"""Certificate composition — multi-step arguments via the PROVEN verdict meet.

A multi-step argument holds only if every step does. Rather than hand-roll three-
valued conjunction logic (a place soundness bugs hide), this reuses the machine-
checked DRIFT_LATTICE meet (lattice.py): VERIFIED<->MATCH (top, composes away),
REFUTED<->DRIFT (bottom, absorbing — a false step makes the whole false),
UNVERIFIABLE in the middle (attenuates). The meet is proven commutative / associative
/ idempotent / monotone and attenuating, so composition can never launder worse steps
into a better verdict — a theorem, not a comment."""

    Distinct from compose(): compose is the conjunctive meet over the STEPS of one argument
    (a single REFUTED absorbs). quorum is a VOTE among independent judges of one claim, and
    it caps any single voice's influence (aperture-sim A1 — a robust aggregator must govern
    the OUTPUT, so no lone loud/unbounded source can flip the verdict). A decided verdict is
    returned ONLY if it wins a strict supermajority of the WHOLE panel; the denominator is
    the total judge count, so abstentions (UNVERIFIABLE) and dissent both count against
    quorum. Consequences (threshold >= 0.5):
      * one false VERIFIED among many cannot reach the supermajority -> UNVERIFIABLE, not VERIFIED;
      * one loud REFUTED cannot veto a true claim (it neither reaches a REFUTED supermajority
        nor blocks a VERIFIED one beyond its single vote) -> the panel still decides;
      * no quorum either way -> UNVERIFIABLE (fail-closed); empty -> UNVERIFIABLE.
    threshold is the fraction of the FULL panel a verdict must exceed (default 0.5 = strict
    majority; pass 2/3 for Byzantine-style robustness tolerating up to ~1/3 bad judges).
