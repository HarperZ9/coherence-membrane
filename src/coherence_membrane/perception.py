"""perceive() — the inert read API a model grounds on.

A model never reaches for the world directly.  It calls perceive(), which runs
the registered organs over the given subjects and returns a PerceptionSnapshot:
a bundle of witnessed Observations the model may reason over.  This is the
read-gate.  It performs NO action and grants NO authority — it only reports what
was witnessed.  Acting on what is perceived goes back out through the write-gate
(see membrane.py).
