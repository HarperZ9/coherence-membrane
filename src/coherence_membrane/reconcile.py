"""The reconcile — the project's single universal operation (the spine).

Perceive any artifact into a witnessed form, judge that form against a criterion it
did NOT author, and carry a re-checkable Certificate; UNVERIFIABLE when you can't.
Trust no assertion — only the witness. Every surface (correctness, accountability,
security, creativity, the author) is one (perceive, criterion) binding of this loop;
the shipped verifier organs are its first instances. Naming the loop makes a new
surface a registration, not a rebuild. Generic by design: depends only on the
Certificate + Observation contracts, never on a specific oracle."""

# --- SPEC: making "a criterion it did NOT author" WITNESSABLE (additive) -------------
# The reconcile's central claim is judgement "against a criterion it did NOT author".
# Until now that independence was asserted by discipline and UNVERIFIED by the system's
# own standard: a Criterion carried no provenance and reconcile() never recorded who
# produced the artifact, so a SELF-graded reconcile (the judge's author == the
# artifact's producer) was byte-indistinguishable from an independent one. This makes
# the property a recorded, checkable WITNESS rather than a hope:
#   * Criterion may OPTIONALLY carry an `author` provenance id (who wrote the judge).
#   * reconcile() may OPTIONALLY accept a `producer` id (who produced the artifact).
#   * reconcile() records both and computes an `independence` field on the Observation:
#       - "witnessed-independent": both present AND differ (author != producer).
#       - "self-authored":         both present AND equal (author == producer).
#       - "unwitnessed":           either absent — THE DEFAULT.
# DEFAULT-PRESERVING: when independence is "unwitnessed" the author/producer ids are NOT
# written into `data`, so every existing call is byte-for-byte unchanged in content (it
# only gains the honest annotation independence="unwitnessed"); two reconciles that
# differ ONLY in an un-witnessed author/producer are byte-identical, exactly as before.
# STRICT MODE (opt-in, default OFF): when enabled, a DECIDED verdict (VERIFIED/REFUTED)
# carried by a `self-authored` criterion is DOWNGRADED to UNVERIFIABLE — the system now
# refuses to launder a self-graded decision as a witnessed one. Default mode leaves
# every verdict EXACTLY as today and only adds the `independence` annotation.
# Soundness over completeness: the absence of a witness is "unwitnessed" (honest),
# never silently "independent".
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sentinel reason emitted when strict mode refuses a self-graded decision.
