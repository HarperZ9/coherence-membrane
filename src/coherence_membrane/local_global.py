"""local_global — the cross-check rung's LOCAL-DECOMPOSITION combinator + its soundness law.

`crosscheck.py::cross_check_validity` runs N GLOBAL methods on the SAME claim — each
decides the whole property and consensus is sound as-is. This module ships the OTHER
shape that rung needs: deciding a GLOBAL property by checking it LOCALLY over a
decomposition (per-prime, per-component, per-coordinate) and combining. There the
inference "all locals pass => the global property holds" is exactly the HASSE
LOCAL–GLOBAL PRINCIPLE, which HOLDS for some classes (quadratic forms / genus-0
conics) and FAILS for others: Selmer's cubic 3x^3 + 4y^3 + 5z^3 = 0 has a solution
in every local field (every p-adic Q_p and the reals) yet NONE over Q. So unanimous
local VERIFIED outside a proven completeness class is a real fallacy — a false GLOBAL
VERIFIED with authority. This combinator catches it: unanimous-local lifts to VERIFIED
ONLY inside an injected, witnessed completeness class; otherwise it downgrades to
UNVERIFIABLE (never VERIFIED). The sound direction is kept whole: a SINGLE local
obstruction (a local REFUTED) refutes the global property.

The completeness-class predicate is INJECTED exactly as `distance` is in `novelty` and
`deviation` is in `structural_fitness` — the criterion-it-did-not-author crosses the
boundary, so this module stays generic with no domain (number-theory) coupling inside.
Soundness over completeness: an absent / unknown / raising class certificate fails
CLOSED to UNVERIFIABLE. This is the verifier-ladder analogue of structural_fitness's
"inability to measure is not unfitness" — inability to lift locally is not global
truth, it is UNVERIFIABLE.

No new verdict algebra: the combine reuses composition.meet_verdicts (the machine-
checked DRIFT_LATTICE meet), so REFUTED absorbs, UNVERIFIABLE attenuates, and a worse
local can never be laundered into a better global verdict — a theorem, not a comment.

numbers" (id NB1VwOWkee4) — the Hasse local–global principle and Selmer's cubic as its
canonical refuter. Cited, never stripped.
