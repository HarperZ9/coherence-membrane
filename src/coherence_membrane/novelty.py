"""novelty — a reconcile criterion for grounded creative novelty.

The Cell *Patterns* result (Dec 2025): naive generate->describe->regenerate loops
collapse to a handful of generic motifs ("visual elevator music") because the critic
is an ungrounded caption. The cure is a SPECIFIC, grounded criterion: judge a work's
perceived signature against the WITNESSED CORPUS of prior work — VERIFIED-novel only
if it is far from everything seen, REFUTED-derivative if it collapses onto something.
This is the creativity surface as a reconcile criterion (perceive the shape with an
organ; judge novelty here). Generic over the signature type + distance metric — a
perceptual hash + hamming is the shipped instantiation; the caller injects both, so
this module stays uncoupled from any particular organ.

Scope: with a perceptual-hash distance this is "not-derivative in the PERCEIVED
signature", not deep-semantic novelty — a 64-bit dHash sees low-frequency structure,
not meaning, so two semantically distinct works can share a coarse signature."""
