"""AtelierMind — the atelier (studio-engine) wired as the center's GENERATE mind.

The atelier is the generative half of the reconcile (the eye is the perceptive half). Here it plugs
into the center behind the `Mind` interface: instead of *reasoning* a text proposal, it GENERATES a
real artifact (a studio-engine World/Scene — phyllotaxis, gyroid, quasicrystal, …) from a seed derived
from the subject view, and contributes a faithful text representation of that generated artifact as its
proposal. On reconcile, it regenerates informed by the other minds' deposits (perturbed seed / chosen
generator). Its sense IS generation.

Optional dependency: `studio_engine`. The center core does not require it; importing this module without
studio_engine raises a clear error only when an AtelierMind is actually used.
