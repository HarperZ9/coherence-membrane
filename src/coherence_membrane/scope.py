"""Consequence scope — mediate consequence, never activity.

Over-mediation is the failure where every creative act has to pass a gate.  The
fix is to gate only actions that cross a hard-to-reverse, outward-facing boundary
(publish, export, overwrite a master, spend, delete, send, deploy) and let
everything reversible and local flow free.  Perception (the continuity loop) is
never gated at all.

This module gives a producer one cheap question — `requires_gate(action_kind)` —
so creative tools can run frictionless and only consult the write-gate for the
rare consequential action.  The scope is the operator's dial: the default is
"consequential writes only", so it limits nothing the operator does not choose
to limit.
