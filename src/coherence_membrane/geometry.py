"""Geometry — the L0 vector primitive (points / polylines / polygons).

The second L0 IR primitive alongside Field. Coordinates are floats in the source
field's pixel space (x rightward, y downward, matching Field row-major indexing).
UNVERIFIABLE is first-class: a Geometry carries the coordinates (cell centres)
where vector structure could not be determined (e.g. a contour cell with an
unknown corner), so downstream encoders report incompleteness rather than imply a
clean trace.
