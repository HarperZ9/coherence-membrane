"""LiveMembrane — the living loop as one configurable object.

This ties the whole read-gate together into the shape the membrane is for: a
thing that PERCEIVES continuously, REMEMBERS an authorized baseline, and mediates
ONLY consequence. It owns no authority of its own — perception is free and
un-gated; acting routes through proof-surface's write-gate, and only for actions
the consequence-scope says are consequential.

  perceive(source)  -> change-proportional, self-throttled ContinuityEvents
  authorize(obs)    -> pin the current state as the baseline (operator's act)
  baseline_check(o) -> MATCH / DRIFT / UNVERIFIABLE vs the authorized baseline
  propose(action)   -> free (reversible/local) OR write-gate decision (consequential)

It is a convenience composition of existing parts; every guarantee still lives in
those parts (inert organs, fail-closed gate, honest drift). The orchestrator adds
no new authority and removes no check.
