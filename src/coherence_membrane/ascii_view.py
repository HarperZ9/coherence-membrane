"""ASCII perception — a compact, model-readable view of a frame.

A perceptual hash answers "did it change" in 64 opaque bits. An ASCII view answers
"roughly what is on screen" in a tiny grid of glyphs a text model can read in
context with no image decode — and a human can eyeball. It is the same move as the
dHash (downscale luma to a coarse projection), but the projection is legible text
instead of bits, which is exactly what makes it cheap to store in a baseline /
receipt and cheap to ground on.

Honesty: an ASCII view is a coarse LUMINANCE projection mapped to a glyph ramp —
advisory evidence of "this region got lighter/darker", NOT a semantic
understanding of the image and NOT OCR. The drift between two views is a literal
per-cell glyph difference, fail-closed on the same closed lattice (MATCH / DRIFT /
UNVERIFIABLE) — a grid-size mismatch is UNVERIFIABLE, never a silent MATCH.

Stdlib only; it reuses the phash grayscale + box-downscale so the projection is
deterministic and re-derivable.
