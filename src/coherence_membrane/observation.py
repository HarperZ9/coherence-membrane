"""The observation contract — the membrane's externalized, witnessed artifact.

An organ does not return a belief; it returns an Observation: a value the
hardware/filesystem actually produced, stamped with provenance (what was read,
its digest, when, and how confident the read itself is).  This is deliberately
wire-compatible with provenance-sensorium's model so the two repos compose
through the shared JSON shape without importing each other.

Three membrane invariants are encoded here, not asserted:
  * Externalized   — every Observation serialises to JSON (to_dict / from_dict).
  * Witnessed      — provenance.digest is the SHA-256 of the witnessed bytes,
                     full width, re-derivable by any host.
  * Advisory       — Status is a report, never an authority grant; there is no
                     TRUSTED/APPROVED/AUTHORIZED status.
