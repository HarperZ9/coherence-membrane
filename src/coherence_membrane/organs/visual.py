"""VisualArtifactOrgan — the membrane's first eye.

Given an image artifact (a rendered frame, a screenshot, any PNG the operator
authorises), it emits ONE witnessed Observation:
  * identity   — full SHA-256 of the raw bytes (exact, re-derivable),
  * dimensions — width/height/bit-depth/colour-type from the PNG header,
  * perception — a 64-bit perceptual hash (dHash) of the decoded pixels.

It is INERT: it reads the artifact bytes and reports.  It does not modify the
artifact, the process that produced it, or anything else.  Capture is the
operator's responsibility and must be of a source the operator owns or has
authorised — this organ never reaches into another process.

Fail-closed: an unreadable file or an unsupported/ malformed PNG yields an
Observation with status UNVERIFIED and perceptual hash absent.  It never raises
and never fabricates a perceptual hash it could not compute.
